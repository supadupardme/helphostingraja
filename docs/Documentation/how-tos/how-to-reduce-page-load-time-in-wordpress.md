As there are many <a href="https://www.hostingraja.in/">cheap web hosting</a> services out there one must look for the reliability as well.

The more the number of server requests your website will make the longer it will take to be rendered. Best can be done is to keep the requests at its minimum.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">In other words one can reduce the image size, lowering the count of posts in a page, uninstalling the plugins that are not used, deactivating those plugins which is not used permanently.</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Enabling the Cache for a Better Speed</strong></span></span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Generally a Wordpress generates an HTML version of the website and at a later part gets server to the browser. However instead of going through this process every single time one can use the finished copy of the page to be displayed to the visitor.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: large;">There are many other ways by which you can speed up the wordpress website, however these were some of the important and easy ways by which you can reduce the loading time of your wordpress website.<br /><br /></span></span>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>The benefits of page Load Time:</strong></span></p> <span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong><br /></strong></span>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>1. Better speed &amp; performance optimization</strong></span></p> <span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: large;">Basically, web performance is the speed in which web pages are downloaded and displayed on the user’s web browser. So by having an optimized website will definitely give you better speed.

And today if you want to add more elements to your website, then you need to make sure you are not sacrificing your website speed — otherwise, you might be losing more than you may gain. Even if your goal is to get more leads, sales, or reduce customer service phone calls, website optimization can be used to make your website more effective at meeting those goals.</span></p> <span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>2. Better user experience</strong></span></p> <span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: large;">If you have followed the above step then there are a lot of advantages in optimizing each page’s speed, although which is one of the most obvious for better user experience. Say that today you've clicked on a website and it seems to take forever to load, then you’ll leave to look for a site that actually loads the answers you need. Similarly a page which is load good will create a good user experience and make them to stay for laong time on that page, which will further convert into leads. </span></p> <span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>3. Better ranking</strong></span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12.16px;"><br /><span style="font-size: large;">If your web page is loading quickly then the number of pages Google can crawl and index will be more. Thus more pages will be indexed hence there is a higher chance that you will have a better ranking of an individual page. So now if you are thinking that how does this work then here is the answer for it- Google has set bandwidth for how much they will crawl on your site in correlation with your page speeds. So if your web page load for a longer time then it consumes more bandwidth and that decreases the number of pages Google will crawl. Moreover if your web page load quickly then your user will spend more time on your website and when people spend more time on your page then these are the signals for Google, to increase your web page rankings.</span></span></p>
