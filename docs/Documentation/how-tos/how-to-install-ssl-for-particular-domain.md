SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization’s details. When installed on a site, it activates https protocol and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser. SSL is used to secure credit card transactions, data transfer, and logins.</span></p>

The public key is placed in the CSR.CSR is a data file which consists of your details and this should be submitted during the SSL certification application process and your details will be validated by the certificate authority and you will be provided with SSL certificate containing your details and allowing you to use SSL.ANd this issues SSL certificate will be matched with your Private key after the server will establish an encrypted link between the browser and the website. All these processes will be invisible to the customer and in the browser, they will view secure symbol to let them know that their connection s encrypted </span></p>

And when the browser connects to this secure website, it checks the certificate and if all details are matched then it displays secure symbol else if it fails it will display a warning in the browser saying that the website is insecure. </span></p>
