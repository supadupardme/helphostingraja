What is Port?
<p dir="ltr">Port numbers are associated with TCP/IP network connections. A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. They allow different applications on the same computer to share network resources simultaneously. Home network routers and computer software work with these ports and sometimes support configuring port number settings.</p>
How Does Port Numbers Work?
<p dir="ltr">Port numbers relate to network addressing. In TCP/IP networking, both TCP and UDP utilize their own set of ports that work together with IP addresses.</p>
<p>In both TCP and UDP, port numbers start at 0 and go up to 65535. Numbers in the lower ranges are dedicated to common Internet protocols (like port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS).</p>
