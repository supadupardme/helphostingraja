    <h2><b>How DNS Works?</b></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before adding any DNS records, you should learn the basics of DNS. You’ll start by dissecting a </span><a href="https://www.hostingraja.in/domains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domain name</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then you’ll learn about the mechanics of DNS resolution, including name servers, zone files, and individual DNS records.</span></p> <br />
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DNS stands for Domain Name System which is also known as the phone book of the internet. As a normal human being we access information online via domain names like- example.com or yourdomain.com etc. Whereas the web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Here is where the DNS plays a major role in translating a domain name into an IP address so that browsers can load the request information from the user.</span></p> <br />
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today devices which are connected to the internet have a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. Which the he of DNS servers it will eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 104.51.525.432 in (in IPv4) or more complex in newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 1994:bs00:1004:1::b29:s7a8 (in IPv6).</span></p> <br />
    <h2><b>What is “DNS propagation”?</b></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you make any changes with your domain name it will take some time for your new domain and DNS changes to be reflected. And the reason behind it is that each ISP automatically updates and caches the DNS records at regular but with unsynchronized intervals. This means that while on IPS may update their cache an hour after you have made your changes another may not up to 3 days. So until your ISP's cache is reset you will not see any changes.</span></p> <br />
