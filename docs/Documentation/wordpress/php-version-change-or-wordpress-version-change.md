  <h2><strong>Why change the PHP version for WordPress?</strong></h2>
  <p></p>
    <span style={{ fontWeight: "400" }}>
      There are many reasons why we should change the PHP version as there is a possibility that themes, plugins and widgets might not be supported by the current PHP version. There is also a possibility that your website might have been developed in 7.0, but the default PHP is 7.4 in that case your website might face many issues. In such cases, you need to upgrade the PHP version to 7.4 so that the website can work.
