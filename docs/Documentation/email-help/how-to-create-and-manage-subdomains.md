<p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>A subdomain is basically a part of the main domain, it is a division or alias of your domain which can be used to organize the website into a separate site.It is used if there is content that is different from the rest of the site.</span></p>
<p><span style={{fontWeight: 400}}>The name of the subdomain will be prefixed before your main domain and the main domain will be separated by a period (the section by the left of the root URL denotes subdomain) An example for the SubDomain: if your main domain name is domainname.com, the subdomain for info.domainname.com or blog.domain.com.</span></p>
