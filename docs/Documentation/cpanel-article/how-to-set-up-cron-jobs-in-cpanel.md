Say what you want to set a particular PHP script on your website where it will be automatically executed on your website based on the time that you have set. To execute this PHP script Cron Jobs are used. Cron jobs are scheduled tasks where the system runs at scheduled times or intervals. For example, You can set up a Cron Job to Erase temporary data each and every week so that the  Disk Space which is applied for the temporary data can be erased which will reduce your disk usage.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&gt;&gt;Cron job does not occupy memory when it is not running. It occupies memory only when it runs</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&gt;&gt;you can easily write the code &amp; you can manage its operation and It eliminates the looping and timing logic so you can run crontab to change the timing or can shut it off.</span></p>
