    <p dir="ltr"><strong><span style={{fontSize: "x-large"}}>Drag Files in cPanel Using File Manager</span></strong></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style={{fontSize: "large"}}>A regular task that is constantly mentioned is that a file or folder be moved from one place to another. This transfer of files or folders will be possible using the Cpanel File Manager. The cPanel (control panel) File Manager allows drag and drop. It means you can simple select the files your want to move and drag them to the desired folder or directory you want to move them to.<br /><br />Step: 1 - First, log in to the Cpanel. <br />Step: 2 - Now, scroll below until you reach the Cpanel's "FILES" section. Then click on FILE MANAGER. Note: We are not using the LEGACY FILE MANAGER (an older interface available in the Cpanel). <br />Step: 3 - When the File Manager opens, you will see that files and folders are arranged in two window panes. <br />Step: 4 - To apply the drag-and-drop method, utilize your mouse and depress the left button (of a two-button mouse) during the mouse pointer is on a file or folder in each of the window panes of the File Manager. Now do not release or loosen the button, then "drag" the mouse pointer to a different location in the file manager where it needs to be placed. On placing the file or folder on the particular location in the Cpanel File Manager, the mouse pointer will be changed into a cross of arrows and there will be text indicating that you're moving 1 file.<br /></span></p>
