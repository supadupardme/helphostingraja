    <p dir="ltr"><span style={{fontSize: "large"}}><br />In this tutorial we are going to discuss how to <strong>protect directories with a password</strong> using cPanel. Visit to your <strong>password protected directory</strong> must type username and password in order to see the contents of those directories.<br /><br />It is very important to protect your WordPress admin (wp-admin) section. Though our wordpress hosting plan comes with many security features, But still we strongly recommend to protect your admin section even in the PHP or any other CMS based websites.<br /></span></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><span style={{fontSize: "large"}}>cPanel &gt;Security &gt;Password Protect Directories.</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style={{fontSize: "large"}}>Once the page is opened, you should see a list of the directories on your hosting account. You can open a directory in order to view its contents by clicking on the folder icon next to its name. Once you have browsed to the directory you are planning to protect, simply click on its name. This should open a new page on which you will be able to create an account that has access privileges to that directory once it has been password protected. Once you have created an account, simply check the box next to “Password Protect This Directory” and save your settings. Password protecting directories is recursive, meaning that once a directory is password protected all sub-directories in it will also be locked.</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style={{fontSize: "large"}}>It is very crucial to <strong>understand how password protection</strong> actually works. When you opt to protect a directory with password using cPanel, cPanel then creates a rule in <strong>.htaccess file</strong> of your website. This rule states that the particular folder or directory is protected with a password and the visitor require to use the accurate username and password to see the files of that particular directory.</span></p>
