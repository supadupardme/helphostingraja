<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">CHECK THE ERROR LOGS!</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">With any error message, particularly one as broad as the 500 Internal Server Error, you will first want to check any Apache and PHP error logs for your server. These logs can provide valuable context related to any code failures or other potential causes of a site failure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">ERROR WITH AN .HTACCESS FILE</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are using a .htaccess on your site, it may be interfering with the web page you are trying to load into your browser. Please double check the .htaccess configuration. Any syntax errors will cause a 500 Internal Server Error message to be displayed instead of your website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">To confirm whether a misconfiguration .htaccess is the cause of the 500 Internal Server error, either remove or rename the .htaccess file temporarily and then try to reload the page</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">PHP CODING TIMING OUT</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">If your PHP script makes external network connections, the connections may time out. If too many connections are attempted and time out, this will cause a "500 Internal Server Error." To prevent these time outs and errors, you'll want to make sure that PHP scripts be coded with some timeout rules. Typically, however, catching a timeout error when connecting to a database or externally to remote resources (example: RSS feeds) are difficult. They, in effect, freeze the script from continuing to run.</p>
<p> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Removing any external connections can increase both the performance of your website and decrease the chances of you receiving a "500 Internal Server Error."<br/><br/></p> </div>
